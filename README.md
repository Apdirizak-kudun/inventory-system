An Inventory Management System (IMS) helps businesses manage and track their inventory of products, raw materials, or assets. It allows users to monitor stock levels, track product sales, handle purchases, and generate reports, ensuring that there is always an adequate supply of products without overstocking or running out of items.


    

# Technology Stack:

1. PHP is used to handle the server-side logic, ensuring smooth communication between the database and the user interface.
JavaScript adds dynamic functionality to the system, making it more interactive and user-friendly.

2. MySQL is the database used to store and manage all inventory-related data, including product details, stock levels, suppliers, and sales.

3. HTML and CSS are used to design a clean, visually appealing, and easy-to-navigate interface.


# Core Features:
